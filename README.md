# Graphql_using_Python

This repository is an Example project using [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/)
and [flask-graphql](https://github.com/graphql-python/flask-graphql) to create a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
server and client pair in Python.

The example server will crawl websites and extract summaries using the library (mostly relying on Opengraph metadata).

You can query the server via [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) by running
the server and visiting `http://localhost:5000`.

---

Queries against the server look like:

    {
      website(url: "https://lethain.com/migrations") {
        title
	image
	description
      }
    }

And responses look like:

    {
      "data": {
        "website": {
	  "title":"Migrations: the sole scalable fix to tech debt.",
	  "image":"https://lethain.com/static/blog/2018/migrations-hero.png",
	  "description":"Migrations are both essential and frustratingly frequent as your codebase ages and your business grows: most tools and processes only support about one order magnitude of growth before becoming ineffective, so rapid growth makes them a way of life. This post takes a look at why migrations are so important, and also how to run them effectively."
	}
      }
    }
